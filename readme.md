# Copy Extension

This was meant to help gather the content in effort to re-design a website, this chrome extension is loaded immediately on page load, when the websites in manifest.json's content_scripts match's are met. When it loads, creates a textarea, fills that textarea with the content of the page and then copies it to a clipboard so it's immediately ready to go.
